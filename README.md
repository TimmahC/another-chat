# chat

Just another chat application that I'm sure many other people have made before. I'm making my own, NOT to take down Whatsapp, Messenger, or whatever new chat app is popular right now, but rather to figure the inner workings of a small scale one. For simplicity, I'll be creating this mostly in Javascript, using Node and Express, with also MongoDB as the backend database. Hopefully, this will work nicely, and if it actually fullfils my initial hopes, we can start thinking about scalability.
